# UX Engineering Test

## A challenge for UX engineers

While this app does technically work it is lacking in both UI design and UX. That's where you come in!

For this test you will be updating the design and applying whatever CSS wizardry you think would make it better.

We will be looking specifically at what you choose to do and how you choose to do it.

Feel free to use libraries like Tailwind. You might also want to move some of the components into their own files/folders.

## Submitting your solution

Clone this repository and set up your own, new repository as the origin remote.

Once your remote repository is ready, add @ckortekaas and @nathanhoad and let us know that you've completed the challenge.
